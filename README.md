# villihouse
a simple web design for villihouse

I spent an afternoon and probably more getting a really simple site worked out for a friend
after they mentioned not liking thier current site as it is.

This is probably not much better but I wouldnt know...

currently the entire thing is only using bootstrap and some css and html.

its only meant to be a bare bones idea with the potential of being something more fleshed out if one wishes.

they are a fantastic artist though
